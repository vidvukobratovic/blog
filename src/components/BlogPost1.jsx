      </p>
      <h3>How To</h3>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Espresso Elegance: Start by pulling a shot of high-quality espresso.
            Using freshly ground coffee beans ensures the capture of the full
            flavor spectrum.
          </li>
          <li>
            Milk Magic: Steam a small amount of milk to a velvety, microfoam
            consistency, steering clear of thick foam. This step aims to
            introduce a subtle creaminess to the espresso.
          </li>
          <li>
            Merging Flavors: Pour the espresso shot into a demitasse or small
            cup, then gently spoon a dollop of frothed milk onto the surface.
            The goal is not to drown but to enhance the coffee with a touch of
            creaminess.

      <h3> Common Misconceptions</h3>
      <p>
        Dispelling misconceptions is crucial for appreciating the authenticity
        of caffè macchiato. It's not a mini latte; rather, it's characterized by
        a small amount of milk subtly enhancing the espresso. Authenticity is
        upheld by steering clear of additives; the magic lies in the simplicity
        of espresso and frothed milk. Additionally, caffè macchiato isn't
        confined to hot servings; it can be equally enjoyed as a cold beverage,
        providing a refreshing alternative on warmer days.
